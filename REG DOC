Subject: Notice of Resignation - Anit Kumar Sarker [EMP ID - 772447]


Hi Debasmita/Abhisek/Manjari,

This email serves as my resignation notice from the position of Assistant Consultant from Tata Consultancy Services Limited. My last day of employment would be 4th September 2022. This includes a notice period of 90 days. 

Resigning from TCS is a difficult decision as I have started my professional career here and this place has given me a lot. I am really thankful to TCS for giving me good opportunities and learning experiences in the last 8.5 years. I am truly grateful for the many rewards and recognizations that working at TCS has given me, as well as for the chances to work with many great teams. When I was taken on as a new hire, I was given the time and freedom to develop fully as a professional. For that I thank you. I will always treasure my team members' support and guidance, especially my seniors. I feel that it is time for a new challenge and experience. If there is any way in which I can help out with the transition, please let me know.


I will be grateful to you if you can acknowledge and accept my resignation and initiate the separation process.


Sincerely,
Anit Sarker
